# Project for User Authentication with Node & MongoDB

This should be fun.

## Testing

Insomnia application used to test **GET** & **POST** methods. All working. Able to signup to MongoDB connection and login.

### Contributions

https://github.com/dipakkr/node-auth/ had a great tutorial on authentication. This will now be adapted to fit other projects I have.
